I rarely write reviews this enthusiastic, but Shuvo truly deserves it. From the very beginning he was polite, patient, and always available — no matter the hour. Even after receiving payment, he continued to give me full support, step by step, with kindness and real professionalism. The software he provided is impressive and powerful. We ran a large test and it worked exactly as promised — accurate, fast, and reliable. He knows his field inside out, and I felt at every moment that I was in good hands. What touched me most is his attitude: he genuinely cares about the success of his clients. He worked with me as if he was part of my team, not just a freelancer. That’s very rare today. I highly recommend him without hesitation, and I truly hope to continue working with him long term. Thank you, Shuvo, for your honesty, speed, and dedication! --- See less
